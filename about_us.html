          <h3>Danielle N. Cunes</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Danielle Cunes and I am majoring with a B.S. in Information Science with a Data Science
            emphasis and minors in Mathematics and Spanish. I am originally from El Paso, Texas, but have called 
            Tucson my home for many years now. I'm especially interested in using data to solve real world problems,
            whether it's through analysis, visualizations, or finding patterns that help drive better decisions. While 
            I plan to go to grad school in the future, right now I'm focues on gaining industry experience and learning
            as much as I can outside the classroom.</p>
            <br>
          <p>Through my coursework and projects, I've enjoyed exploring how data connects across different fields
            and how tools like machine learning and statistical analysis can lead to impactful insights. I'm excited to 
            find opportunities where I can keep learning, collaborate with others, and grow in a role that fits my 
            passion for data and problem-solving.

          <h3>Chi Thieu</h3>
          <p>
              My name is Chi Thieu -pronounced like 'chee' in cheesecake. I am a senior international student from Vietnam, 
              pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Information Science. Alongside my studies, I am also minoring in 
              Business Administration and Economics, which helps me connect the technical aspects of computing with strategic
              problem-solving. </p>
          <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
          <p>
              I am eager to apply my skills in a data scientist role to gain hands-on experience, deepen my expertise, and start
              preparing for graduate school. Looking ahead, I aspire to be ambitious in my career, aiming to pursue a Ph.D. after
              a few years in the industry. My goal is to explore the vast world of data and contribute to meaningful advancements 
              in the field. </p>
